          It has been a year of change the world over,
          and for us it has not been any different.
          There have been quiet endings and new beginnings,
          some planned and others unexpected.
          Sickness, protest, isolation, and politics
          have been themes in the news and in our lives.
          Although mostly physically distant,
          if anything this year has brought us closer together
          and helped bring our priorities into clearer view.
          In 2020 we have stayed close to home
          and are grateful for what we have,
          including each other,
          our family,
          our circle of friends,
          and the community that surrounds us.

          The year started normally enough.
          We still took the subway to work every day.

          We kept going to see a play or musical a month,
          including <em>The Woman in Black</em> and <em>West Side Story</em>
          in January and February.
          We were supposed to see <em>Jagged Little Pill</em> with family in mid-March,
          but COVID-19 came in and &ldquo;the world turned upside-down.&rdquo;

          You&rsquo;ve all seen it.
        </p>
        <p style="top: 9vw; width: 37vw;">
          Soon nearly everything around us was closed.
          Our Brooklyn neighborhood &mdash;
          normally loud and bustling &mdash;
          was quiet except for the regular sounds of sirens.
        </p>

        <p style="left: 50vw; top: 15vw; width: 37vw;">
          We all learned how to social distance in stores.
        </p>
        <p style="left: 7vw; top: 110vw;">
          And just how long six feet really is.

        <p style="left: 4vw; top: 57vw; width: 85vw;">
          Our home and work life changed pretty radically.
          We built up a collection of masks sewn for us by family members,
          and learned to wash them by hand whenever we came in from outside.

          &hellip; and Tom&rsquo;s office.
          Luckily Tom&rsquo;s teams were already distributed,
          so working remotely wasn&rsquo;t a huge change there,
          but we had to juggle who had meetings when.
        </p>
        <p style="left: 3vw; top: 91vw;">
          Ruby was over it pretty quickly.

          Ruby was over all of that pretty quickly, too.

        <p style="left: 4vw; top: 4vw; width: 86vw;">
          After George Floyd was killed
          (and so many others before him),
          New York City woke back up.
          As the songs of sirens faded,
          the chants of Black Lives Matter took their place.
          We joined other educators in the city,
          nervous about coronavirus
          but concerned and restless
          about the injustices we saw and felt around us.
        </p>

        <p style="left: 68vw; top: 15vw; width: 22vw;">
          After three months of being confined in our apartment,
          the protests reminded us about the life and vitality of the city,
          and we began walking again.
          Exploring the city has always been one of our favorite things to do together,
          and this spring and summer the city felt like a new place,
          with places we expected to be quiet busy,
          and places we expected to be busy quiet.
        </p>

        <p style="left: 2vw; top: 2vw; width: 50vw;">
          We saw evidence of what we already knew:
          That New Yorkers are resilient,
          and they love their city.
        </p>

      <div>

        <p style="left: 20vw; top: 2vw; width: 51vw;">
          And New Yorkers are innovative,
          making use of every space,
          moving fine dining into gardens,
          sidewalks,
          and bike lanes.

          With all the other New Yorkers stuck in their apartments,
          we found refuge in the parks.

          And sought out small adventures in what was easily accessible. 
        </p>
        <p style="left: 8vw; top: 80vw; width: 76vw;">
          While we haven’t even left the state this year,
          we can at least now say we have been to its southernmost point!
          Thank you for our great escape, Staten Island!

        <p style="left: 2vw; top: 2vw; width: 40vw;">
          Summer brought many changes for us personally.
          While most of the change up until this point was out of our control,
          other big changes were planned out well in advance.
          For the last year we&rsquo;d been planning
          that this year would be our last in New York City,
          hoping to relocate to the Hudson Valley.
          We began exploring towns between Beacon and Tarrytown
          for somewhere to call home
          with the hopes of a house and a yard.
          We both grew up in small towns,
          close to nature and mountains,
          and we missed that,
          but we could not bring ourselves to move any farther
          than an hour and a half away from The City.
        </p>

        <p style="left: 3vw; top: 53vw; width: 54vw;">
          Teresa said goodbye to her students and her Brooklyn classroom.
          The hope was she would find a job locally somewhere,
          whether at a school or museum nearby.
          Tom continued working his job,
          and we planned that he would take the commuter train
          a couple times a week to his office in Manhattan.

        <p style="left: 33vw; top: 2vw; width: 46vw;">
          In the middle of the pandemic
          we followed what few plans we could:
          We bought a car,
          packed up our things and our pets,
          and moved north to Fishkill, NY.

          Tom has an actual home office,
          now complete with a standing desk and curved monitor
          (and the cutest coworkers).
          The office in Manhattan has not reopened since March,
          and there is no date set for when or if it will reopen again.
          Although the train into the city really is quite nice,
          this setup suits him just fine.

          Perhaps our favorite feature of the house is the fire pit,
          which will be wonderful for hosting each and every one of you,

          We are quite taken with sitting on our Adirondack chairs

          Completing the virtual version of the Great Saunter was a motivator,
          walking over 32 miles in two weeks.
          While it wasn&rsquo;t the same experience
          as walking the perimeter of Manhattan in a single day,
          it was a good excuse to get ourselves out of the house and into nature.

          Exploring small towns is always fun,
          but even nicer with company,
          however masked and socially distant it might be.
          In October we met up with other Hudson Valley transplants,
          Anita and Ben,
          to go apple picking.
          Altovise came for an afternoon to join us on a leg of our virtual Saunter.
          Effie and Erick came up from Brooklyn
          to hike and see what &ldquo;upstate&rdquo; New York life is like.
          Liam and Coco visited from Lake Placid
          to experience Halloween somewhere closer to Sleepy Hollow.

          Someday soon we will all be together again,
          but until then take care of yourselves and your loved ones.
          We want to wish you and yours a safe,
          happy,
          and healthy holiday season.
          We hope 2021 brings good news and glad tidings.
