          Happy (belated) holidays!
          We always intend for these cards to get to you in time for Christmas,
          or at least New Year’s.
          As with the snow arriving at our house,
          it is arriving a little later this winter.
          Better late than never, as long as it happens eventually.
          (But, really, we’d like that snow sometime, please!)

          This year has felt less full of major change compared to recent years
          and more like an evolution of previous states.
          We’re still living in the Hudson Valley,
          still spending most of our time together.
          We transitioned from pandemic isolation by more regularly leaving our town, our region, our state.
          In our adventures this year we intentionally went mostly to places we knew
          to reconnect with people we love and haven’t seen in far too long
          (and feels like even longer).

          Since we’re both working from home,
          we spend most of our waking hours with the dogs.
          Ruby and Raku continue to bring us a lot of joy every day,
          whether playing or snuggling under a pile of blankets.

          We love living in New York and keep finding new adventures upstate.

          Travel became a more regular part of our lives again this year.
          The pandemic showed us how content we can be at home,
          but going on real vacations also reminded us how much there is to see a little farther afield.
          This spring we drove to North Carolina,
          where Tom spent many summers,
          but hadn’t visited since he was a kid.

          to celebrate the wedding of Teresa’s childhood best friend Tricia
          and her husband Mike, in Colorado.
          After their family-only pandemic wedding, the party was postponed to 2022.
          We were so happy to see them not only at their party,

          While in Colorado, we stayed at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park.
          Ever seen “The Shining”?
          This bar might look familiar.
          Stephen King was staying at this hotel when he came up with the idea for the story.
          Tom – an avid horror fan – has been excited to stay there since he learned of it years ago,
          and we finally made it happen.

          In August,
          after finishing all of the classwork for her graduate program,
          Teresa made a trip out to Iowa to see family,
          including spending time with her dad in his garden,
          and (finally!) visiting her cousin Breanna in Ames
          to take a campus tour of Iowa State.

          No matter how many times we go to Santa Fe it is always magical and always wonderful.
          The architecture, the elevation, the food, the memories, the people.
          One night we were able to have dinner with Teresa’s college friends Laura and RJ.
          We stayed downtown
          with Carole and Tim coming in from Seattle,
          and Matt and Martha coming from DC.
          We went to galleries and breweries and on the ski lift to see the changing colors.

          The next day we were supposed to see the Grand Canyon.
          We were staying right there,

          Get to the edge and only fog.

          and we decided we had to see some.

          These are on a whole other level,
          made with fresh fruit, not syrup.
          We now find ourselves craving them from time to time.

          This fall we both had some personal changes.
          In September Teresa started working as a policy analyst at ExcelinEd.
          She mostly works remotely in her art studio/music room/office
          (plus some travel out of state),
          reading and writing about education policies across the country.
          It’s a big shift away from teaching high school,
          but it’s good to do work that tries to make teaching better for teachers
          (and tries to make sure students have good teachers in their classrooms).

          Tom turned 40.
          To celebrate, Teresa took him out for a night in NYC.
          It involved surprise tickets to see Little Shop of Horrors,
          one of Tom’s favorite musicals since childhood.

          The second part of the birthday celebration was a weekend in Vermont
          with Tom’s childhood friends,
          nerding out with some D&amp;D.
          Tom hadn’t played since high school.
          Teresa had never played before.
