# wedding-site

This is the code for running a website for a wedding.
The primary purpose for this software is to let people see where all of our receptions are.
Then they can choose to RSVP to any they are able to attend.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.
See `project.clj` for more information about the project's requirements.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

You can also run the web server from within a REPL:

    user=> (use 'wedding-site.handler :reload)
    user=> (def server (run {:join? false}))

And you can stop it and restart it:

    user=> (.stop server)
    user=> (def server (run {:join? false}))
