# wedding-site

This is the code for running a website for a wedding.
The primary purpose for this software is to let people see where all of our receptions are.
Then they can choose to RSVP to any they are able to attend.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.
See `project.clj` for more information about the project's requirements.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

You can also run the web server from within a REPL:

    user=> (use 'wedding-site.handler :reload)
    user=> (def server (run {:join? false}))

And you can stop it and restart it:

    user=> (.stop server)
    user=> (def server (run {:join? false}))

(Thanks to Dave Ray for explaining how to do that
on [his blog][along came betty].)

## Contributing

### Commit Messages

This project follow's [Angular's commit message format][commit format].
Refer to the linked document for the full details.
But here's a quick reference:

    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <footer>

The type must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process
  or auxiliary tools and libraries
  such as documentation generation

### Issues

This project uses a text file in [GNU Recutils][] format to track issues.
These include both enhancements and defects.
This way we get a bug database that
(a) is easy to manage in a text editor,
(b) lives in the repository,
and (c) can still be flexibly queried.

Here are a few useful queries.
Note that you have to have recutils installed.

    $ # Show all open enhancements.
    $ recsel -e "Type = 'Enhancement' && Status != 'Closed'" issues.rec

    $ # Show all open defects.
    $ recsel -e "Type = 'Enhancement' && Status != 'Closed'" issues.rec

    $ # Count the number of open issues by type.
    $ recsel -e "Status != 'Closed'" -p "Type,Count(ID):Count" -G "Type" issues.rec

    $ # Verify there are no syntactic or formatting problems.
    $ recfix --check issues.rec
