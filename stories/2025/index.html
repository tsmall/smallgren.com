            Happy holidays from the Lundgren-Small family!
            It has been a <em>huge</em> year.
            Our family expanded by one! Grace finally
            moved in with us at the beginning of the summer
            and we've been pretty inseparable ever since.
            Life will never be the same again!
            There's so much to share with you.
            We hope you enjoy this snapshot of our year.

            Grace is a smart, talented, energetic,
            hilarious young lady.
            She loves to bake,
            to sing,
            to act,
            to play,
            and to dance.

            In the future she wants to be an elementary school teacher

            she truly puts her mind to.

            Teresa has entered her Mom era. 
            A lot of what she enjoyed about 
            teaching was interacting with kids, 
            and becoming a parent has been relationship
            building on a whole other level. 
            She is re-learning how to be playful and
            how fun it is to play pretend.
            She's also learning how vastly different
            teaching and parenting are, and that
            no level of experience with kids
            could have prepared her for
            having one of her own.

          <p>
            Work in the world of teacher policy continues to be good.
            Teresa still feels that she has really found her calling.
            It's also been a source of travel for her, including
            twice this year to New Orleans, once to Washington, D.C. ...

            ... and once to Salt Lake City. While in Utah she
            met up with her co-worker, Lindsey Henderson, and
            her favorite teacher of all time (and one of her all-time
            favorite people), Lisa Hales. Teresa hardly sees her 
            co-workers in person and hasn't seen Lisa in well over
            a decade, so it was especially fun to see them
            both and have parts of her world collide.

            Grace and Teresa gave him an amazing first Father's Day.

            Before starting school, Grace was able to
            participate in multiple local day camps, 
            including ceramics camp and playwriting camp.
            Her play "The Dreaded Pencil" is sure to become
            an instant classic!

            Since early fall we've been down to
            New York City a few times to get Grace 
            used to the hustle and bustle. We met up
            with Teresa's cousin, Elizabeth, and her 
            family at Hamilton's Grange up in Harlem.

            And what is fall without Halloween?
            Our group costume this year was centered around
            Grace's favorite Disney movie, Tangled. 
            Grace was Rapunzel. Tom and Teresa were her
            real parents, the king and queen, 
            who'd been searching for her
            her whole life. Ruby was her pet chameleon, Pascal.
