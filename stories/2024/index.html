            Happy holidays!
            We have so much to share with you &mdash;
            especially because we missed sending out cards last year.
            But let’s start with the big news first,
            since it’s probably on the top of everyone’s minds.
            (It’s certainly on the top of ours!)

            Our family is expanding!
            We are in the process of adopting a daughter from foster care.
            Since it’s ongoing,
            we are not sharing her name or photos of her this year.
            Things we can share, though:
            She’s 11 years old,
            she loves koalas,
            and she’s amazing.
            We already have her bedroom ready
            for her when she moves in.

            We’ve been in the adoption process since August 2023.
            Neither of us felt like we needed biological children,
            but we both like kids.
            The idea of one day adopting actually came up on our second date
            (Tom cut straight to the chase with the kids question
            and Teresa has always liked the idea of adopting).
            Last year we decided we were finally ready.
            A lot of paperwork,
            parenting classes,
            a home study
            and a search process later,
            we finally met our future daughter in early October
            and have seen her on or near every major holiday since then.

            and where we want to go in the future.
            We have a lot to share,

            Tom
            (pictured here in his 2023 Halloween costume)
            is enjoying his 40s so far.
            He has rediscovered how much he enjoys board games
            and tabletop roleplaying games,
            and through them spending time with family and friends.

            He is still enjoying his job at PowerSchool.
            At the end of 2024 he switched roles,
            from an architect role to a management one.
            He is now managing two teams focused on innovation projects.

            In 2023 Tom got to attend re:Invent,
            an annual conference
            run by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
            It’s huge,
            spread across five or so casinos in Las Vegas.
            It was easily the most elaborate tech event he’s ever been to.

            Tom’s 40th birthday party was the start of a new routine,
            where he and Teresa meet with Tom’s longtime friends
            and their families
            for a weekend of games and activities.
            This video is from one of those weekends,

            She is now an Associate Policy Director,
            analyzing, writing about, and making recommendations on laws

            Over the last two years,
            Teresa has gone on a number of work trips across the country.
            One of the benefits of virtual work,
            we have turned a number of these trips into workcations:
            spending a few extra days in a place,
            working from “home”,
            and exploring the city at night.
            Work trips allowed us to see Nashville
            and go to the Grand Ol’ Opry for the first time,
            and for Teresa to visit her friend Altovise in Atlanta.

            Teresa has returned to making ceramics.
            She became a member at The Newburgh Pottery to make friends and art.
            In the last year she’s made a set of dishes
            and a number of bowls and vases,
            but people in the studio mostly think of her making animals,
            like these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_ware">raku</a> sculptures of Raku our dog.

            When it’s time for a nap,
            she is also demanding &mdash;

            We’ve completed a few house modifications the past couple of years.
            The biggest project was in 2023
            when we installed a proper bar with a tap,
            which was Teresa’s present to Tom for his 40th birthday.
            Smaller projects in 2024 were painting our bedroom,
            painting the half-bath,
            and changing our guest room into a kid’s room.

          <p>
            Outside we made some changes, too.
            In 2023, Teresa’s Dad, Mike, came out from Iowa
            to help us finally start a vegetable garden in the yard.
            Berries, Brussels sprouts, and salad greens are regular favorites.
            In the future, we hope we will get some apples from our trees!
            Also in 2023,
            Tom’s uncle David came up from Georgia
            to replace our old deck with Trex.
            No more needing to worry about falling through rotting planks for us!

            Making up for lost travel time post-COVID,
            2023 had four major trips:
            Washington and Oregon,
            France,
            Iceland,
            and New Mexico and Colorado.
            Three of the four were with Teresa’s sister, Carole,
            and Carole’s husband, Tim.
            Carole and Tim visited us multiple times since the pandemic,
            but in May 2023,
            it was about time we got ourselves out again to see them in Seattle.
            (And about time we got to stay a night in the iconic TWA hotel
            at the JFK airport.
            Look at this place!

            As someone born on Bastille Day,
            it was important to celebrate that date with her in France.

            our local airport flies to.
            “Have you been to Iceland yet?”
            is something of a discussion starter in the Hudson Valley.
            Iceland also happened to be the first trip we took
            after formally deciding to enter into the adoption process.
            Every activity yielded a discussion of,
            “This would be so fun to do with a kid sometime.”

            We toured Denver’s Meow Wolf (seen here).
            We visited Teresa’s former radio cohost, Norm, in Fort Collins,
            sadly our last time seeing him before he passed away.
            And we went to Longmont to see her elementary school best friend,
            Tricia,
            and met her baby for the first time.

            In May 2024 &mdash;
            after receiving approval from New York State to become adoptive parents &mdash;
            we returned to Denmark and Sweden,
            where we went for our honeymoon in 2016.
            The pastries, in typical Scandinavian fashion, were divine.

            The timing was perfect.
            We were able to procure tickets to both dress rehearsals
            for the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest in Malmö, Sweden.
          </p>
          <p>
            A memory we will always have
            is our interaction with the seemingly surly man
            at Iceland’s passport control.
            He asked what the purpose of our trip was,
            and when we said “Eurovision”
            his face lit up
            and he responded with “REALLY?! Have you listened to Norway’s song??”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was so fun to see how many people got so excited for the event
            and how the city embraced it.

            and stepmom, MaryKaye,
            wanted to go on a big family trip to Alaska.
            In August,
            Rusty and MaryKaye brought us, Kayleigh, and Alex
            on an Alaskan cruise.
            In cruiser fashion,
            we had matching shirts (thanks MaryKaye!)
            and had most meals together.
            It was great spending so much time together,

            The highlight of all the excursions
            (for Teresa, at least)
            was out of Ketchikan,
            seeing black bears in the wild during salmon season.
            At the wildlife preserve
            we saw at least 10 black bears in the course of an hour,
            including this mama and her cub.

            Many people have written about how being in nature recharges people,
            and that was definitely true of our time in Alaska.
            That’s one of the reasons we love returning to the Adirondacks too.
            So it was funny to find a boat connecting the two on our trip!
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the trip,
            we got off the boat with Kayleigh and Alex one more time
            in Victoria, BC,
            to get drinks with Teresa’s mom’s best friend from high school,
            Bizzy,

            Sadly,
            Tom’s grandmother, Nonnie, passed away shortly after we got back.
            But we had a wonderful celebration of her life,
            where we got to reconnect with many people in Tom’s family
            that we hadn’t seen in a long time.
            And it also led to a group chat for all of Tom’s cousins.
            So, much like Nonnie did while she was alive,
            she brought her family together again.
